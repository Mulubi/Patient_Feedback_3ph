# STARTING A VIRTUAL ENV
- run sudo apt install python3.11-venv
- run python3.11 -m venv venv
- run source venv/bin/activate

# INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES
- run python3.11 -m pip install Flask
- run python3.11 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# INITIALIZE THE DATABASE FILE
Now that init-db has been registered with the app, it can be called using the flask command, similar to the run command from the previous page.

Note
If youâ€™re still running the server from the previous page, you can either stop the server, or run this command in a new terminal. If you use a new terminal, remember to change to your project directory and activate the env as described in Installation.

Run the init-db command:

$ flask --app Flask_App init-db
Initialized the database.
There will now be a flask_app.sqlite file in the instance folder in your project.

# RUN THE APP USING A LOCAL db
- run flask --app Flask_App run --debug
